	<h3>house blend coffee</h3>
	<img src="col.jpeg" width="50%"alt="">
	<p>House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you pour a cup of a house blend coffee, you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast and have intermediate flavor. Here at Carta Coffee, our house blends are our Captain's Roast and Meridian Roast coffees. </p>

	<h3>French Roast</h3>

	<p>Simply put, “French roast” describes the color of the coffee beans after they have been roasted. These beans are on the darker end of the scale, and are usually the color of dark chocolate. It does not mean the coffee was grown or roasted in France (although yes, that is where the roasting style originated in the 1800s).

￼

The name is believed to reflect the tastes and traditions of coffee roasters in Europe in the 19th century, where dark roasted coffee was all the rage. Italian roast, or espresso roast, was nearly as dark as French, and Vienna roast – a staple of the Viennese cafes and pastry shops known for their great coffee – was slightly lighter than Italian roast. But the French proudly took the honors as the darkest roast of all.

Many different kinds of beans can be roasted to the French roast level, and they do not need to originate from any specific region to qualify. French roast coffee can be made from Central American, African, or Indonesian beans. Essentially, beans grown anywhere in the world can be used to make French roast.

	<h3>Colombian Roast</h3>

	<p>Not always! Colombian coffee also has a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast of the coffee isn’t actually related to the growth of the coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used to make both light roasts and dark roasts. Now, the richer and flowery flavor of Colombian coffee beans does make them especially suited for a dark roast, but light roasts made from Colombian beans are also amazing.</p>
